## DESCRIPTION
SUPERscript is a game, created by Sivan Adler and Maria Cristina Simoes, that is designed to help teach children how to code in Javascript. A user is able to sign in and choose their character. Once they are signed in, the user will be prompted by a specific challenge for each level. Below that challenge, the user will see a text editor, where they are prompted to fill in the missing line of code to pass the challenge for that level. Once the user is confident in their answer, they can click the 'run' button to see if their code passes the test. If their code is correct, they'll move to the next level. However, if their code is incorrect, they will see an error pop up that gives them clue towards solving the challenge. If the user still doesn't know how to proceed, they can click the 'hint' button to recieve a hint, or click the 'solution' button to see what the correct answer is for that level.
